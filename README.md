## Description
The aim of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a CRUD application written in Javascript. The app is implemented through the use of RESTful APIs to record the user's cryptocurrency transactions. A third-party API from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) is comsumed to provide real time cryptocurrency prices. [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io) and [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) password encryption are used for user authentication, which are considered the industry standards.
